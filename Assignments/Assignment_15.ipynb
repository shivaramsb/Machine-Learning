The goal is to partition the dataset into clusters such that data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in different clusters. Clustering is used in various applications such as customer segmentation, image segmentation, anomaly detection, and data compression. Common clustering algorithms include k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN."
