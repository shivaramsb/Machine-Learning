It is critical because the quality and relevance of features directly affect the model's ability to learn and generalize from the data. Effective feature engineering can lead to significant improvements in model accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. Techniques include creating interaction terms, polynomial features, and aggregating data at different levels."
